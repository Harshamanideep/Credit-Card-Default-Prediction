Credit card default prediction is a critical task for financial institutions to effectively manage credit risk and minimize potential losses. In the context of Taiwan's credit landscape, there is a need to develop accurate predictive models that can identify customers at risk of defaulting on their credit card payments. The objective of this project is to create a robust predictive model that can forecast the likelihood of default for individual customers based on various demographic, financial, and payment history factors. By addressing this challenge, financial institutions can make informed decisions, implement proactive risk management strategies, and ultimately safeguard their financial health.

DATA COLLECTION:
The project begins by sourcing a comprehensive dataset that includes customer information such as credit limit, payment history, bill amounts, education level, marital status, and age. This dataset, sourced from '/creditproject.csv', serves as the foundation for building the predictive model.
